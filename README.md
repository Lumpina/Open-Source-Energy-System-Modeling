# Open Source Energy System Modeling
Training for the VU

## Learnings
After successful completion of the course, students are able to understand the benefits of open source software/data, how to use open source tools and licenses, and are able to work with the IAMC (integrated-assessment community) data format to develop energy system models.
Lecture slides and recordings of several lectures from previous years are available at https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/teaching/ under an open-source license.
## Content
### Lecture 1
We will discuss the principles of open-source and collaborative scientific programming for energy systems modelling and integrated assessment of climate change. Concepts include version control using GitHub, the principles of code review, documentation, unit tests and continuous integration.
### Lecture 2
Integrated assessment models are a key tool for developing narratives and quantifying pathways to understand system transitions and impacts of policy measures. We will discuss different model types which can be used in this area, and we will review the role of numerical modelling of human and earth systems for policy-makers in the context of the IPCC reports and other global outlooks.
### Lecture 3
We will use the pyam package, a Python package for visualizing and analyzing integrated assessment scenarios, for understanding climate change mitigation pathways used in the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6, 2022).
### Lecture 4
We will turn to developing a national-scale energy system model using the open-source pypsa modeling framework. After working through an example, students will implement a stylized model for scneario analyis.
### Lecture 5
We will discuss how to extend the stylized national energy system model developed in lecture 4 into an integrated assessment model by including land use and agriculture, water use, and other aspects of sustainable development.
