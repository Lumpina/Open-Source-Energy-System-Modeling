The pyam package has been developed for learning github.
Please use the GitHub Issues feature to raise questions concerning potential bugs or to propose new features, but search and read resolved/closed topics on similar subjects before raising a new issue.
For contributions to the code base, please use GitHub Pull Requests, including a detailed description of the new feature and unit tests to illustrate the intended functionality. Code submitted via pull requests must adhere to the pep8 style formats and the documentation should follow the numpydoc docstring guide. We are using ruff to check the code style.
We do not require users to sign a Contributor License Agreement, because we believe that when posting ideas or submitting code to an open-source project, it should be obvious and self-evident that any such contributions are made in the spirit of open collaborative development.
